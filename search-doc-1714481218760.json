Let us check how many records we have in our table info SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders_updates We are going to land the new data files in our source directory. We use this helper function coming with our bookstore dataset to copy new files in our source directory info This allows us to simulate somehow an external system writing data in this directory, and each time we execute the celll, a new file will be landed in our source directory Run the cell twice to add new data files.

Instead, you can display it in a much better way using the display function info files = dbutils.fs.ls('/databricks-datasets') display(files) Here we see the output is rendered in a tabular format with some fields like: path;filename;size;modification time With the display function, you can also download data as CSV file and render the result as a graph info However, the display function is limited to preview only 1000 records note When running SQL queries from cells, results will be always displayed in a tabular format like here, so there is no need to use the display function with SQL.

And the course ID actually references the course ID in the course table I can define here a primary key for the orders table and this can be our order ID info CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, CourseID VARCHAR(100), CustomerID VARCHAR(100), Discountpercent INT, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID) FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID), FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID) ) We can create these tables actually within our appdb database itself In this query window which I already have open, I will paste in all of the statements to create these tables If you click on tables here and hit on the refresh button, we will see our course table, our customer table and the orders table Insert some values into the customer table. So, I am inserting 3 rows of information. I have the customer ID and the customer name info INSERT INTO Customer( CustomerID, CustomerName ) VALUES ( &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;UserA&quot; ); INSERT INTO Customer ( CustomerID, CustomerName ) VALUES ( &quot;C2&quot;, &quot;UserB&quot; ); INSERT INTO Customer ( CustomerID, CustomerName ) VALUES ( &quot;C3&quot;, &quot;UserC&quot; ); Let us insert some rows into the course table. So, again, I am inserting 3 rows of information info INSERT INTO Course ( CourseID, CourseName, Price ) VALUES ( &quot;D1&quot;, &quot;AZ-900&quot;, 99.99 ); INSERT INTO Course ( CourseID, CourseName, Price ) VALUES ( &quot;D2&quot;, &quot;DP-900&quot;, 100.99 ); INSERT INTO Course ( CourseID, CourseName, Price ) VALUES ( &quot;D3&quot;, &quot;AZ-104&quot;, 89.99 ); We can insert the information into the orders table In terms of the orders table, I am ensuring that I have a course ID that is defined in the course table and a customer ID that is defined in the customer table info INSERT INTO Orders ( OrderID, CourseID, CustomerID, Discountpercent ) VALUES ( 'O1', 'D2', 'C1', 90 ); INSERT INTO Orders ( OrderID, CourseID, CustomerID, Discountpercent ) VALUES ( 'O2', 'D1', 'C2', 50 ); INSERT INTO Orders ( OrderID, CourseID, CustomerID, Discountpercent ) VALUES ( 'O3', 'D3', 'C3', 60 ) If I try to insert a row of information into the orders table where I have a unique OrderID, I do have a courseID that is defined as D3 This is available in the course table, but I am putting a customer ID of C4 The customer ID is not defined in the customer table. If I try to insert this record into the table, I am going to get an error It is a foreign key constraint error, because I don't have that information defined in the customer table ","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"1.4 Creating an Azure Free Account","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/DP203 – Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure 2023/Introduction/1.4 Creating an Azure Free Account","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"How to create an Azure Free Account​","type":1,"pageTitle":"1.4 Creating an Azure Free Account","url":"/docs/DP203 – Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure 2023/Introduction/1.4 Creating an Azure Free Account#how-to-create-an-azure-free-account","content":"  Go to the following website info https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ Click on the Start free button Sign in with a Microsoft-based account or create a new one Click on Next Create a password for my Microsoft account Click on Next Verify the code info It will send a code onto your e-mail account Click on Next Solve a puzzle Click on Next Specify a region Enter your first name and last name Enter your phone number Click on text me Enter the verification code Specify your credit card information Enter your address, your city, and your state Click on Sign up Click on the portal icon  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"1.6 Quick Note – Security Defaults","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/DP203 – Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure 2023/Introduction/1.6 Quick Note – Security Defaults","content":"1.6 Quick Note – Security Defaults I want to give a quick note when it comes onto the security defaults When you create your Azure account, you might be prompted for something known as multifactor authentication info This means that in addition to entering a username and a password to log into your account, Microsoft will ask you for an additional level of authentication info For example, you might need to use a mobile device to complete the entire authentication process and this could happen every time you want to log into the Azure account What you can do is when you are logged into Microsoft Azure, go into a service known as Azure Active Directory In the default directory, go on to properties In properties, you can go ahead and scroll down, click on manage security defaults Here in terms of security defaults for you, it might be enabled.
