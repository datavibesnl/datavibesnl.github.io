# 3.5 Higher Order Functions and SQL UDFs

## Introduction

- [ ] In this notebook, we will explore higher order functions and user-defined functions also known as UDF<br/>

- [ ] We will continue using our bookstore dataset, which contains the 3 tables of customers, orders and books

## Dataset setup

- [ ] Let us start by copying this dataset

    :::info
        ```sh
        %run ../Includes/Copy-Datasets
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Let us take a look again on our orders table

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM orders
        ```
    :::

- [ ] As you can see here, the books column is of complex data type<br/>

    :::info
        In fact, it's an array of a **`struct`** type
    :::

- [ ] To work directly with such a complex datatype<br/>

- [ ] We need to use higher order functions

## What are Higher Order Functions?

- [ ] Higher order functions allow you to work directly with hierarchical data like arrays and map type objects

## How to use higher order functions?

### Use the **`filter`** function to filter an array based on a condition

- [ ] One of the most common higher order functions is the **`filter`** function which filters an array using a given **`lambda`** function<br/>

- [ ] In this example, we are creating a new column called **`multiple_copies`**, where we filter the books column to extract only those books that have a quantity greater or equal to 2

    :::info
        It means they have been bought in multiple copies, 2 or more
    :::

- [ ] We are creating a new column called **`multiple_copies`**, where we have an array that contains only the filtered data

    :::info
        ```sql {4}
        SELECT 
            order_id, 
            books,
            FILTER(books, i -> i.quantity >= 2) AS multiple_copies
        FROM orders
        
        ```
    :::

- [ ] As you can see, we are creating a lot of empty array in this new column<br/>

- [ ] In this case, it is useful to use a **`WHERE`** clause to show only non-empty array values in the return column<br/>

- [ ] We can accomplish that by using a subquery, which is a query within another query in order to apply the **`WHERE`** clause on the size of the returned column

    :::info
        ```sql {6}
        SELECT 
            order_id, 
            books,
            FILTER(books, i -> i.quantity >= 2) AS multiple_copies
        FROM orders
        WHERE size(multiple_copies) > 0;
        ```
    :::

### Use the **`transform`** function to apply transformations to every single item in an array

- [ ] Our second higher order function is the **`transform`** function that is used to apply a transformation on all the items in an array and extract the transformed value<br/>

- [ ] In this example, for each book in the books array, we are applying a discount on the subtotal value

    :::info
        ```sql {4-7}
        SELECT
            order_id,
            books,
            TRANSFORM (
                books, 
                b -> CAST(b.subtotal * 0.8 AS INT)
            ) AS subtotal_after_discount
        FROM orders;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] As you can see, we created a new column containing an array of the transformed values for each element in the books array

## How to create user-defined functions (UDFs)?

- [ ] Let us now talk about user-defined functions or UDFs, which allow you to register a custom combination of SQL logic as function in a database, making these methods reusable in any SQL query<br/>

- [ ] UDF functions leverage Spark SQL directly maintaining all the optimization of Spark when applying your custom logic to large datasets<br/>

- [ ] Here is an example of creating a user-defined function. At minimum, it requires a **`function name`**, **`optional`** parameters, the **`type`** to be returned, and some **`custom logic`**

    :::info
        ```sql {1-4}
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_url(
            email STRING
        )
        RETURNS STRING
        
        RETURN CONCAT("https://www.", split(email, "@")[1])
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Our function here is named **`get_url`**, that accepts an **`email`** address as an argument and return a value of type **`STRING`**. Here we are splitting the email into two parts based on the **`@`** sign

    :::info
        ```sql {6}
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_url(
            email STRING
        )
        RETURNS STRING
        
        RETURN CONCAT("https://www.", split(email, "@")[1])
        ```
    :::

## How to use UDF functions

- [ ] Let us now start to using it. Here we are applying our UDF on the customer emails to get the URL address

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            email,
            get_url(email) AS domain
        FROM customers
        ```
    :::

    :::note
        User defined functions are permanent objects that are persisted to the database, so you can use them between different Spark Sessions and Notebooks
    :::

- [ ] With **`DESCRIBE FUNCTION`** command, we can see where it was registered and basic information about expected inputs and the expected return type

    :::info
        ```sql
        DESCRIBE FUNCTION get_url
        ```
    :::

- [ ] As you can see our function, it belongs to the default database and accept the email address as a string input, and return a string value<br/>

- [ ] We can get even more information by running **`DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED`**

    :::info
        ```sql
        DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED get_url
        ```

        For example, the Body field at the bottom shows the SQL logic used in the function itself
    :::

## How to add more complex logic in UDF functions

- [ ] We can have more complex logic in our function. For example, here we are applying the standard SQL **`CASE WHEN`** statements in order to evaluate multiple condition statements within our function<br/>

- [ ] Here, for example, we are checking the email extension using the **`LIKE`** command in order to detect the category of the domain name and otherwise, we are reporting it as unknown extension

    :::info
        ```sql {3-10}
        CREATE FUNCTION site_type(email STRING)
        RETURNS STRING
        RETURN CASE
            WHEN email LIKE "%.com" THEN "Commerical business"
            WHEN email LIKE "%.org" THEN "Non-profit organizations"
            WHEN email LIKE "%.edu" THEN "Educational institution"
            ELSE CONCAT(
                "Unknown extension for domain: ", 
                SPLIT(email, "@")[1]
            )
        END;
        
        SELECT 
            email, 
            site_type(email) as domain_category
        FROM customers;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] As you can see UDF functions are really powerful<br/>
