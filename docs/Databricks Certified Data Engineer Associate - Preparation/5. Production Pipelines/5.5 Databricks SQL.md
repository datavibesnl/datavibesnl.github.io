# 5.5 Databricks SQL

- [ ] In this video, we will explore Databricks SQL<br/>

- [ ] During all previous videos, we were working in the **`Data Science & Engineering`** workspace<br/>

- [ ] In order to work with Databricks SQL, we need to switch to the SQL persona on top of the sidebar<br/>

- [ ] Databricks SQL, also known as DBSQL is a data warehouse that allows you to run all your SQL and BI applications at scale and with a unified governance model<br/>

- [ ] As you can see in the sidebar, you have new options like SQL editor, Queries, Dashboards, Alerts<br/>

- [ ] In addition to Data Explorer and SQL warehouses<br/>

- [ ] Let us start by clicking on the **`SQL warehouse`** tab<br/>

- [ ] From here, we can create our first SQL warehouse

    :::info
        A SQL warehouse is the compute power of Databricks SQL
    :::

    :::note
        It is a SQL engine or endpoint based on the Spark cluster
    :::

- [ ] Click on **`Create SQL Warehouse`** to configure a new SQL engine<br/>

- [ ] Give it a name, say demo warehouse<br/>

- [ ] Set the cluster size to **`2x small`**<br/>

- [ ] For this demo, leave all other options as default and click **`Create`**<br/>

- [ ] If it shows you a menu to manage the permissions for the SQL warehouse, leave all other options as default and click Close<br/>

- [ ] Our SQL warehouse is running and ready to be used<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Dashboards`** in the sidebar<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Visit gallery`**<br/>

- [ ] From here, click **`Import`**, next to the New York Taxi Trip Analysis option

    :::info
        Like this, we have created our first dashboard
    :::

- [ ] If we click again on Dashboards in the sidebar<br/>

- [ ] We can see our sample dashboard we have just created, and I have my name under the **`Created By`** field

    :::note
        Note that from this page, you can also create a new dashboard from scratch
    :::

- [ ] Let us click on our dashboard's name to reopen it<br/>

- [ ] We can any time click **`Refresh`** to rerun the queries behind each graph and refresh the data<br/>

- [ ] To view the query behind any graph, simply click on the three vertical dots on the graph, and select **`View Query`** from the menu

    :::note
        Note here the three tiers namespaces that is used to identify the source table, which are: catalog, database and table name
    :::

    :::info
        This is a preview of the new functionality to be supported by Unity Catalog
    :::

- [ ] Let us click **`Run`** to preview the result of this query<br/>

- [ ] In the **`Table`** tab, we can see the query results<br/>

- [ ] If we click on the second tab, we switch to the preview of our graph<br/>

- [ ] Click **`Edit visualization`** to modify this graph<br/>

- [ ] From here, you can change the setting of your visualization<br/>

- [ ] Let us click **`Cancel`** for now<br/>

- [ ] To add a new visualization using this query, click the **`+`** sign<br/>

- [ ] Then, **`Visualization`**<br/>

- [ ] Let us create a pie graph<br/>

- [ ] We set the **`X`** column as day of week<br/>

- [ ] Add a **`Y`** column for fare_amount<br/>

- [ ] Let us leave all other settings as defaults and click **`Save`**<br/>

- [ ] Click on the tab to give this visualization a name<br/>

- [ ] If we click on the three vertical dots of this tab. We have the option to add this graph to a dashboard<br/>

- [ ] We select our sample dashboard<br/>

- [ ] We click **`Add`**<br/>

- [ ] Let us navigate back to the dashboard to view this change<br/>

- [ ] If you scroll down, you can see your new graph has been successfully added to the dashboard<br/>

- [ ] We can adjust the organization of the graphs in a dashboard<br/>

- [ ] From the three vertical button, click **`Edit`**<br/>

- [ ] We can drag our visualization. Resize it<br/>

- [ ] Let us click on **`Done Editing`**<br/>

- [ ] You can share your dashboard with other users<br/>

- [ ] Click the **`Share`** button<br/>

- [ ] Select, for example, all users from the top field<br/>

- [ ] Choose **`Can Run`** permission<br/>

- [ ] Click **`Add`**<br/>

- [ ] From **`Credentials`**, you can choose to run using the viewer credentials if the user have access to the underlying data

    :::info
        If not, choose the Run As Owner to run the dashboard using the owner credential
    :::

- [ ] Let us now navigate to the editor to write some custom queries<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`+`** button<br/>

- [ ] Choose create new query

    :::info
        Make sure you are connected to a SQL warehouse
    :::

- [ ] Click on the schema browser to select the Sample Catalog<br/>

- [ ] Select a database, click on **`Select`**

    :::info
        Choose NYC Taxi<br/>

        In this database, we have only one table called trips
    :::

- [ ] Click on the table name to get a preview of its schema<br/>

- [ ] Let us write our first query<br/>

- [ ] To add the table name to the query text, we can simply hover over the table name and click this double arrows button

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM nyctaxi.trips
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Let us now click on **`Run`** to preview the results<br/>

- [ ] Let us update this query by adding a **`GROUP BY`** clause on the **`pickup_zip`** code

    :::info
        ```sql {5}
        SELECT 
            pickup_zip,
            SUM(fare_amount) AS total_fare
        FROM nyctaxi.trips
        GROUP BY pickup_zip
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We will add this column again to the **`SELECT`** clause. And apply some aggregation function on the **`fair_amount`**<br/>

- [ ] We give this column an alias called **`total_fare`**

    :::info
        ```sql {3}
        SELECT 
            pickup_zip,
            SUM(fare_amount) AS total_fare
        FROM nyctaxi.trips
        GROUP BY pickup_zip
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Click **`Run`** to preview the results<br/>

- [ ] We can save our query by clicking on the **`Save`** button<br/>

- [ ] Give it a name<br/>

- [ ] We can also add the query result to a dashboard<br/>

- [ ] Click on the three vertical dots on the **`Table`** tab, then **`Add to Dashboard`** and we select our sample dashboard<br/>

- [ ] If we navigate back to our dashboard, and we scroll down, we can see that our query result has been successfully added to the dashboard<br/>

- [ ] You can also set a schedule for the query to refresh the result automatically<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`Schedule`** button<br/>

- [ ] Use the dropdown menu to change to refresh **`every one week at 7 a.m.`**<br/>

- [ ] Click **`Okay`**<br/>

- [ ] If we navigate to **`Queries`** in the sidebar, we can find our saved query. <br/>

- [ ] In Databricks SQL, we can use the saved query to set up an alert<br/>

- [ ] From the left side bar, navigate to **`Alerts`**<br/>

- [ ] **`Alerts`** in Databricks SQL allow you to receive notification when a field of your query meets a certain threshold<br/>

- [ ] Click **`Create Alert`** in the top right<br/>

- [ ] Select your saved query<br/>

- [ ] Let us first give this alert a name, by clicking on the field at the top left of the screen<br/>

- [ ] For the **`Trigger When`** option, set the value column to **`total_fare`**, with a condition greater than **`10,000`** threshold<br/>

- [ ] For **`Refresh`**, we can select **`Never`**<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Create Alert`**<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`Refresh`** button to evaluate the alert

    :::info
        If the top row value has been updated and exceeded this thresholds, the alert will be triggered and I will receive a notification on this email
    :::

- [ ] You can set other destination to receive notifications<br/>

- [ ] If you click on the **`Add`** button, you can choose either an existing alert destination, or create a new destination in the **`Alert Destinations`** page<br/>

- [ ] As you can see, you have plenty of alerting options like Slack and Microsoft Teams<br/>
