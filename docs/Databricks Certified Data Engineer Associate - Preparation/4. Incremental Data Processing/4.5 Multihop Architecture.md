# 4.5 Multi-hop Architecture

- [ ] We will talk about multi-hop architecture in the Lakehouse<br/>

## What is a multi-hop architecture?

- [ ] A **multi-hop** architecture, also known as **medallion** architecture, is a design pattern used to logically organize data in a multi-layered approach<br/>

- [ ] Its goal is to incrementally improve the structure and the quality of the data as it flows through each layer of the architecture<br/>

## Layers of a multi-hop architecture

- [ ] Multi-hop architecture usually consists of 3 layers

1. **`Bronze`**

    * Bronze table contains raw data ingested from various sources

        :::info
            Like JSON files, operational databases, or Kafka Stream, for example
        :::
        
2. **`Silver`**

    * Silver tables provide a more refined view of our data

        :::info
            For example, data can be cleaned and filtered at this level
        :::

        :::note
            We can also join fields from various bronze tables to enrich our silver records
        :::

3. **`Gold`**

    * The gold table provide **business-level aggregations**, often used for reporting and dashboarding or even for machine learning<br/>

- [ ] With this architecture, we incrementally improve the structure and the quality of data as it flows through each layer

## Benefits with multi-hop architecture

- [ ] It is a simple data model that is easy to understand and implement<br/>

- [ ] It enables incremental ETL, that is Extract, Transform and Load data incrementally<br/>

- [ ] It can combine streaming and batch workloads in the same pipeline

    :::info
        Each stage can be configured as a batch or streaming job
    :::

- [ ] It can recreate your tables from raw data at any time
