# 6.2 Managing Permissions (Hands On)

- [ ] In this demo, we will explore how to manage permissions for databases, tables and views in Databricks SQL<br/>

- [ ] Navigate to the Databricks SQL workspace<br/>

    :::note
        Make sure that your SQL warehouse is running
    :::

- [ ] Navigate to the **SQL editor** in the left sidebar<br/>

- [ ] In this demo, we will create a database called **`hr_db`**

    :::info
        ```sql {1}
        CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hr_db
        LOCATION 'dbfs:/mnt/demo/hr_db.db'
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We will create a table called **`employees`** with **`id`**, **`name`**, **`salary`**, and **`city`** columns

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE employees(
            id INT,
            name STRING,
            salary DOUBLE,
            city STRING
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Then we will insert some data in this table

    :::info
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO employees 
        VALUES (
            1, "Anna", 2500, "Paris"
        ), (
            2, "Thomas", 3000, "London"
        ), (
            3, "Bilal", 3500, "Paris"
        ), (
            4, "Maya", 2000, "Paris"
        ), (
            5, "Sophie", 2500, "London"
        ), (
            6, "Adam", 3500, "London"
        ), (
            7, "Ali", 3000, "Paris"
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We will create a view for employees in Paris city

    :::info
        ```sql {5}
        CREATE VIEW paris_employees_vw 
        AS SELECT 
            * 
        FROM employees
        WHERE city = "Paris";
        ```
    :::

## How to configure permissions to a new database and table

- [ ] In order to allow other users to access this new database and table, let us configure their permissions<br/>

- [ ] We will create a new query<br/>

- [ ] Let us start by granting several privileges on the whole **`hr`** database to a group of users called **`hr_team`**<br/>

- [ ] All members in this group will have the ability to read, and modify the data, access metadata information, and also the ability to create a new object like tables and views in this database

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT SELECT, MODIFY, READ_METADATA, CREATE 
        ON SCHEMA hr_db TO hr_team;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] For users to perform any action on a database object, they must have an additional privilege, which is the **`USAGE`** privilege

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA hr_db
        TO hr_team;
        ```

        Without this privilege, the objects in the database cannot be used
    :::

- [ ] We can run a specific SQL command simply by selecting it and click **`Run Selected`**

## How to grant permissions to individual users

- [ ] We can also assign privileges to individual users<br/>

- [ ] Here, for example, we are granting a read access on our view object to a user from outside of the HR team

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT SELECT ON VIEW hr_db.paris_employees_vw
        TO 'adam@mycompany.com'
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Let us select this query and click **`Run Selected`**<br/>

- [ ] Let us review the assigned permissions using the **`SHOW GRANTS`** command

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA hr_db;
        ```

        The HR team has all the granted privileges. And me, I am the owner of this database as I was the one who created it
    :::

- [ ] We can also show the granted privileges on our view

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW GRANTS ON VIEW hr_db.paris_employees_vw;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Here we can see the user Adam indeed has the **`SELECT`** privilege on this view<br/>

- [ ] The HR team inherited the database privileges

## How to use Data Explorer to manage permissions

### How to use Data Explorer to view permissions

- [ ] In addition to SQL editor here, we can also use the Data Explorer to manage permissions<br/>

- [ ] From the left side navigator, select the **`Data`** tab to access the **`Data Explorer`**<br/>

- [ ] The **`Data Explorer`** allows users and admins to navigate different data objects like databases, tables and views, explore data schema, metadata and history in addition to setting and modify permissions<br/>

- [ ] From here we can find the database we created previously<br/>

- [ ] By clicking on the database name, it displays a list of the containing tables and views on the left hand side<br/>

- [ ] On the right, you will see some details about the database, like the owner information<br/>

- [ ] Use the **`Permissions`** tab to review who currently has permissions on this database

    :::info
        We see here the granted privileges for the HR team group
    :::

- [ ] You can select a privilege here and click on **`Revoke`** to remove this privilege

    :::info
        The privilege has been successfully revoked
    :::

- [ ] From here, we can also change the owner<br/>

- [ ] If you click here, you have the option to edit the owner

    :::info
        An owner can be set as an individual or a group
    :::

- [ ] Let us set the owner to admins, which is the default group containing all workspace's administrators<br/>

- [ ] As you can see, the admin group now is the owner of this database

### How to use Data Explorer to grant permissions

- [ ] From this window you can also grant permissions<br/>

- [ ] Let's say we would like to allow all user to review metadata about this database<br/>

- [ ] Click the **`Grant`** button<br/>

- [ ] Select All Users group<br/>

- [ ] Choose both **`READ_METADATA`** and **`USAGE`** privileges<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Grant`**<br/>

- [ ] Similarly, we can manage permissions for tables and views<br/>

- [ ] Click on the table name<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`Permissions`** tab<br/>

- [ ] From here, let us, for example, give all users the ability to query this table<br/>

- [ ] Click first on **`Grant`** button<br/>

- [ ] Select all users group<br/>

- [ ] Choose the **`SELECT`** privilege<br/>

- [ ] Click **`Grant`**<br/>

- [ ] The **`Data Explorer`** is really useful and powerful tool to manage your data objects

    :::info
        At present only the **`ANY FILE`** object cannot be set from the data explorer. You need to use the SQL editor instead
    :::

- [ ] What's interesting about Databricks is it is that you can see all the SQL queries run behind the Data Explorer<br/>

- [ ] Navigate to the **`Query History `**in the left sidebar<br/>

- [ ] As you can see, query history shows all the queries run in the Databricks SQL, including the Data Explorer<br/>
