# 6.1 Data Objects Privileges

- [ ] In this video, we will talk about data object privileges in Databricks<br/>

- [ ] You will understand the Databricks Data Governance model<br/>

- [ ] You will learn how to manage permissions for different data objects like databases, tables and views<br/>

- [ ] The data governance model in Databricks lets you programmatically **`GRANT`**, **`DENY`**, and **`REVOKE`** access to your data from Spark SQL<br/>

- [ ] Here is a general command that allows you to give an access privilege on a specific data object to a user or group of users

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT Privilege
        ON Object <object_name>
        TO <user or group>
        ```

        We can give read access, translated by the ability to do a **`SELECT`** operation, on a table called **`my_table`**
    :::

- [ ] This permission is assigned to **`user_1`**<br/>

- [ ] This table here is a data object on which we set permissions

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT SELECT
        ON TABLE my_table
        TO user_1@company.com
        ```
    :::

## Data objects

- [ ] Let us see what our other object types we have in Databricks<br/>

- [ ] Databricks allows you to configure permissions for the following object types

| Object | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **CATALOG** | Controls access to the entire data catalog |
| **SCHEMA** | Controls access to a database |
| **TABLE** | Controls access to a managed or external table |
| **VIEW** | Controls access to SQL views |
| **FUNCTION** | Controls access to a named function |
| **ANY FILE** | Controls access to the underlying filesystem |

## Privileges

- [ ] The following privileges can be configured on the data objects

| Privilege | Ability |
|-----------|---------|
| **`SELECT`** | Read access to an object |
| **`MODIFY`** | Add, delete and modify data to or from an object |
| **`CREATE`** | Create an object |
| **`READ_METADATA`** | View an object and its metadata |
| **`USAGE`** | No effect required to perform any action on a database object |
| **`ALL PRIVILEGES`** | Gives all privileges |


## Granting Privileges by Role

| Role | Can grant access privileges for |
|------|---------------------------------|
| **Databricks administrator** | All objects in the catalog and the underlying filesystem |
| **Catalog owner** | All objects in the catalog |
| **Database owner** | All objects in the database |
| **Table owner** | Only the table |
| **...** | ... |

## More operations

- [ ] In addition to **`GRANT`** operation, you have also other useful operations to manage object privileges

    :::info
        You can deny and revoke privileges
