# 6.3 Unity Catalog

- [ ] In this lecture, we will see an overview of Unity Catalog, which is the new governance solution of Databricks platform<br/>

## What is Unity Catalog?

- [ ] **Unity Catalog** is a centralized governance solution across all your workspaces on any cloud<br/>

- [ ] It unifies governance for all data and AI assets in your Lakehouse including:

    -  Files;
    -  Tables; 
    -  Machine learning models;
    -  Dashboards

    :::info
        These can be simply achieved using SQL language
    :::

- [ ] With Unity Catalog, you define your **data access rules** once across multiple workspaces and clouds

## Architecture

- [ ] Before Unity Catalog, users and groups were defined per workspace<br/>

- [ ] Access control was managed via the Hive metastore within the workspace<br/>

- [ ] Unity Catalog sits out of the workspace and accessed via a user interface called the Account Console<br/>

- [ ] Users and the groups for Unity Catalog are managed through this account console and assign it to one or more workspaces<br/>

- [ ] Metastores are likewise separated out of the workspaces and managed through the account console where they can be assigned to the workspaces<br/>

- [ ] A Unity Catalog metastore can be assigned to more than one workspace, enabling multiple workspaces to share the same DBFS storage and the same access control lists

## Unity Catalog 3-level namespace

- [ ] We saw previously the traditional two-level namespaces used to address tables within the schemas<br/>

- [ ] Unity Catalog introduces a third level, which is catalogs<br/>

- [ ] Let us understand better the hierarchy of Unity Catalog<br/>

- [ ] The **metastore** is the top level logical container in Unity Catalog<br/>

- [ ] It represents metadata, that is, information about the objects being managed by the metadata, as well as the access control list that govern access to those objects<br/>

- [ ] In a metastore, you have **catalog**, which is the top level container for data objects in Unity Catalog, and forms the first part of the three level namespace we just saw

    :::info
        Don't confuse Unity Catalog metastore with the Hive metastore
    :::

- [ ] The **Hive store** is the default metastore linked to each Databricks workspace

    :::info
        While it may seem functionality similar to a Unity Catalog metastore, Unity Catalog metastores offers improved security and advanced features<br/>

        Unity Catalog metastore can have as many catalogs as desired
    :::

## Unity Catalog Hierarchy

- [ ] Catalogs contain **schemas**<br/>

- [ ] A **schema**, also known as **database**, is the second part of the three-level namespace<br/>

- [ ] Schemas usually contain data assets like **tables**, **views** and **functions**, forming the third part of the three-level namespace<br/>

- [ ] You need to catalog also support authentication to the underlying cloud storage through Storage Credentials<br/>

- [ ] **Storage Credentials** apply to an entire storage container<br/>

- [ ] **External Locations** represent the storage directories within a cloud storage container<br/>

- [ ] In addition, Unity Catalog adds **Shares and Recipients** which are related to Delta Sharing<br/>

- [ ] **Shares** are collections of tables shared with one or more recipient

    :::info
        Data sharing is out of scope for this course
    :::

## Unity Catalog Identities

- [ ] In Unity Catalog, we have three types of identities <br/>

1. **`Users`** are individual physical users which are uniquely identified by their email addresses

    * A user can have an admin role to perform several administrative tasks important to Unity Catalog, such as managing and assigning metastores to workspaces and managing other users

2. A **`service principle`** is an individual identity for use with automated tools and applications

    * Service principles are uniquely identified by Application ID

    :::info
        Like users, service principles can have an admin role which allow them to programmatically carry out administrative tasks
    :::

3. We have **`Groups`** that collect users and service principles into a single entity

    * Groups can be nested with other groups

    :::info
        For example, a parent group called Employees can contain two inner groups: HR and Finance groups
    :::

## Identity Federation

- [ ] Databricks identities exist at two levels: at **account-level** and at **workspace-level**<br/>

- [ ] Unity Catalog supports a feature called **Identity Federation**, where identities are simply created once in the accounts console<br/>

- [ ] They can be assigned to one or more workspaces as needed<br/>

- [ ] Identity Federation eliminates the need to manually create and maintain copies of identities at workspace-levels

## Privileges

- [ ] Unity Catalog has **`CREATE`**, **`USAGE`**, **`SELECT`** and **`MODIFY`** privileges<br/>

- [ ] In addition, we have also privileges related to the underlying storage which are **`READ FILES`** and **`WRITE FILES`** which replace the **`ANY FILE`** privilege we saw previously with Hive metastore<br/>

- [ ] We have **`EXECUTE`** privilege to allow executing user defined functions

## Security Model

- [ ] Unity Catalog uses a different security model than Hive metastores for granting privileges<br/>

- [ ] There are different privileges types, and extra securable objects and principles<br/>

- [ ] We continue to use **`GRANT`** statement in order to give a privilege on a secure object to a principle

    :::info
        ```sql
        GRANT Privilege ON Securable_Object 
        TO Principal
        ```
    :::

## Accessing legacy Hive metastore

- [ ] Unity Catalog is additive, this means that your legacy Hive metastore is still accessible once Unity Catalog is enabled<br/>

- [ ] Regardless of the Unity Catalog metastore assigned to the workspace, the catalog named hive_metastore always provide access to the Hive metastore local to that workspace

## Features

- [ ] Unity Catalog also has a built-in data search and discovery<br/>

- [ ] Unity Catalog also provides automated lineage where you can identify the origin of your data and where it is used across all data types like tables, notebooks, workflows and dashboards<br/>

- [ ] Unity Catalog unifies existing legacy catalogs

    :::info
        There is no hard migration needed when enabling Unity Catalog

- [ ] In order to access the account console, you can log in as an account administrator via this link
