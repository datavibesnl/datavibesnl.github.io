# 2.9 Working with Views (HandsOn)

- [ ] In this notebook, we will create and explore views<br/>

- [ ] We are going to first create one of each type of views<br/>

- [ ] We start by creating a table of data to be used in this demonstration<br/>

- [ ] We are creating a table called smartphones. That has **`id`**, **`name`**, and the **`brand`** of the phone and the **`release`** year<br/>

- [ ] We are inserting some data in this table

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE IF EXISTS smartphones (
            id INT, 
            name STRING,
            brand STRING,
            year INT
        )
        
        INSERT INTO smartphones 
        VALUES (
            1, 'iPhone 14', 'Apple', 2022
        ),
        (
            2, 'iPhone 13', 'Apple', 2021
        ),
        (
            3, 'iPhone 6', 'Apple', 2013
        ),
        (
            4, 'iPad Air', 'Apple', 2013
        ),
        (
            5, 'Galaxy S22', 'Samsung', 2022
        ),
        (
            6, 'Galaxy Z Fold', 'Samsung', 2022
        ),
        (
            7, 'Galaxy S9', 'Samsung', 2016
        ),
        (
            8, '12 Pro', 'Xiaomi', 2022
        ),
        (
            9, 'Redmi 11T Pro', 'Xiaomi', 2022
        ),
        (
            10, 'Redmi Note 11', 'Xiaomi', 2021
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We can check the created table in the **`Data Explorer`**<br/>

- [ ] We can use the **`SHOW TABLES`** command to show the list of tables and views as well<br/>

- [ ] As we can see here, we have one table called **`smartphones`** in the default database<br/>

- [ ] Let us now create a stored view that shows only Apple's phones<br/>

- [ ] Here we use the **`CREATE VIEW`** statement followed by the view name<br/>

- [ ] In our case, it called **`view_apple_phones`** and with the **`AS`** keyword, we specify our logical query

    :::info
        ```sql {1-2}
        CREATE VIEW view_apple_phones
        AS SELECT *
        FROM smartphones
        WHERE brand = 'Apple'
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Here we are selecting from smartphone table all records having a brand equal Apple<br/>

- [ ] Let us now query our view<br/>

- [ ] We use the standard **`SELECT`** statement just as if it were a table

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM view_apple_phones;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Each time a view is queried, the underlying logical query of the view is executed against the table<br/>

- [ ] Let us run **`SHOW TABLES`** command again

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We see that the view has been persisted to the default database. And of course it is not a temporary object<br/>

    :::info
        We can confirm this also from the Data Explorer.
    :::

## How to create a temporary view

- [ ] Let us now create a temporary view<br/>

- [ ] The syntax is very similar but we add a **`TEMPORARY`** keyword or simply a TEMP keyword<br/>

- [ ] The logical query of this view is simply retrieving the unique list of the brands in our smartphones table

    :::info
        ```sql {1}
        CREATE TEMP VIEW temp_view_phones_brands
        AS SELECT DISTINCT brand
        FROM smartphones;
        
        SELECT * FROM temp_view_phones_brands
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Here is the list of brands retrieved by the temporary view<br/>

- [ ] Let us run the **`SHOW TABLE`** command again<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Here, we see that the temporary view has been added to the list<br/>

- [ ] The **`isTemporary`** column shows that this view is indeed a temporary object. And since it is temporary, it is not persisted to any database<br/>

## How to create a global table

- [ ] We create a global temporary view<br/>

- [ ] We simply add the **`GLOBAL`** keyword to the command<br/>

- [ ] Our global temporary view is called **`global_temp_view_latest_phones`**, since the logical query here is retrieving all the smartphones from our table that has a releasing year newer than 2020 and we order the result in descending order, to show first the most recent phones<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql {1}
        CREATE GLOBAL TEMP VIEW global_temp_view_latest_phones
        AS SELECT * FROM smartphones
        WHERE year > 2020 ORDER BY year DESC;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] To query a global temporary view in a select statement, we need to use the global database qualifier, which is in fact a temporary database in the cluster

    :::info
        ```sql {1}
        SELECT * FROM global_temp.global_temp_view_latest_phones;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Let us review one last time the database table and views

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Our global temporary view is not listed here as it is tied to the **`global_temp`** database<br/>

- [ ] To show tables and views in the **`global_temp`** database. We use the command SHOW TABLES IN and we specify the database, in our case, it's **`global_temp`**

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES IN global_temp;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Here, we can see the **`global_temp_view_latest_phones`**, which is tied to the **`global_temp`** database

    :::info
        Since our temp_view_phones_brands is not tied to any database, it is usually shown with every **`SHOW TABLES`** command
    :::

## How tables and views are persisted across multiple sessions

- [ ] We are going to create a new notebook, which means a new **`SparkSession`**, and explore how our created views will behave there<br/>

- [ ] In this new **`SparkSession`**. let us first run the **`SHOW TABLES`** command

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] The result here confirms that the table smartphones, of course, still exist<br/>

- [ ] As expected, the stored view of Apple phones still exist in this new session. However, the temporary view of the brand phones does not exist<br/>

- [ ] Let us go back to the previous notebook and rerun the **`SHOW TABLES`** command

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] All these three tables and views from this old session are still here<br/>

- [ ] Let us go back to the new notebook<br/>

- [ ] Temporary views are not accessible, for example, from another notebook<br/>

- [ ] Or after detaching and re-attaching a notebook to a cluster or after installing a Python package, which in turn, restarts the Python interpreter, or simply after restarting the cluster<br/>

- [ ] What about the global temporary view?<br/>

- [ ] Let us run the command **`SHOW TABLES`** IN **`global_temp`**

    :::info
        ```sql
        SHOW TABLES IN global_temp;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Our global temporary view still exists

    :::info
        In fact, as long as the cluster in running, the database global_temp persist, and any notebook attached to the cluster can access its global temporary views
    :::

- [ ] We can see this in action by querying this global temp view in this session


    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM global_temp.temp_view_latest_phone;
        ```
    :::

- [ ] If you were to restart the cluster, this statement would fail because the view will no longer exist<br/>
