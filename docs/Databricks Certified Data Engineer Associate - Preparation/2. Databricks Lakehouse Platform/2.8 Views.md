# 2.8 Views

- [ ] In this video, we will talk about the views in Databricks<br/>

- [ ] You'll understand what is a view in Databricks and how to work with it. In addition, we will explain the different types of views<br/>

- [ ] A view in Databricks is a virtual table that has no physical data

    :::info
        In fact, it is just a saved SQL query against actual tables. This query is executed each time a view is queried
    :::

## Types of Views

- [ ] There are three types of views in Databricks

1. **Stored Views**

    - [ ] Like tables stored views are presented in the database

        * To define a view, we use the **`CREATE VIEW`** statement with the **`AS`** keyword followed by your SQL query

        * Once created, you can query your view with a standard **`SELECT`** statement, just as if it were a table

        :::info
            ```sql
            CREATE VIEW view_name
            AS query
            ```
        :::

2. **Temporary Views**

    - [ ] Temporary view is tied to a Spark session, so it dropped when the session ends<br/>

    - [ ] To create a temporary view, we simply add **`TEMP`** or **`TEMPORARY`** keyword to **`CREATE VIEW`** command

        :::info
            ```sql
            CREATE TEMP VIEW view_name
            AS query
            ```
        :::

    - [ ] When a **`SparkSession`** is created in Databricks<br/>

    - [ ] There are several scenarios in which a new Spark session is created

    :::info
        For example, when opening a new notebook, a new session is created. Also, when detaching and reattaching a notebook to a cluster. And after installing a Python package, which lead to restarting the Python interpreter. Or simply after restarting the cluster.
    :::

3. **Global Temporary Views**

    - [ ] It behaves much like other views, but differs in one important way. It is tied to the cluster<br/>

    - [ ] As long as the cluster is running, any notebook attached to the cluster can access its global temporary views<br/>

    - [ ] To define a global temporary view, we simply add **`GLOBAL TEMP`** to the command<br/>

    - [ ] Global temporary views are added to a cluster's temporary database called **`global_temp`**

        :::info
            ```sql
            CREATE GLOBAL TEMP VIEW view_nameAS query
            
            SELECT * FROM global_temp.view_name
            ```
        :::

    - [ ] When you query this view in a SELECT statement, you need to use the global_temp database qualifier

## Comparison between views

| (Stored) Views | Temp Views | Global Temp Views |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Persisted in DB | Session-scoped | Cluster-scoped |
| Dropped only by **`DROP VIEW`** | Dropped when session ends | Dropped when cluster restarted |
| **`CREATE VIEW`** | **`CREATE TEMP VIEW`** | **`CREATE GLOBAL TEMP VIEW`** |
