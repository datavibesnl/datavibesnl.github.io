# 1.6 Quick Note â€“ Security Defaults

- [ ] I want to give a quick note when it comes onto the security defaults <br/>

- [ ] When you create your Azure account, you might be prompted for something known as multifactor authentication <br/>

    :::info
        This means that in addition to entering a username and a password to log into your account, Microsoft will ask you for an additional level of authentication
    :::

    :::info
        For example, you might need to use a mobile device to complete the entire authentication process and this could happen every time you want to log into the Azure account
    :::

- [ ] What you can do is when you are logged into Microsoft Azure, go into a service known as Azure Active Directory<br/>

- [ ] In the default directory, go on to properties<br/>

- [ ] In properties, you can go ahead and scroll down, click on manage security defaults<br/>

- [ ] Here in terms of security defaults for you, it might be enabled. So, what I have done is I have just disabled this<br/>

    :::info
        If you don't want to be prompted for multifactor authentication every time you log into your Azure account you only want to enter username and your password
