# 1.3 Azure and the Azure Free Account

- [ ] Azure is a cloud platform where you have different products in place<br/>

- [ ] The benefit of an Azure free account is you get $200 worth of free credit to start with for the first 30 days<br/>

- [ ] Normal services actually don't come for free when it comes on to the Azure platform and they do incur a cost<br/>

- [ ] When you convert afterward you need to convert your account onto something known as a pay as you go account<br/>

- [ ] If you manage your resources properly, you can manage your cost accordingly<br/>

- [ ] You need a phone number, a credit card, or a debit card, and a Microsoft account or a GitHub account<br/>

- [ ] The credit card initially is only used from a security perspective<br/>

- [ ] Once the credit is over, then you will be asked to convert onto something known as a pay as you go subscription<br/>
