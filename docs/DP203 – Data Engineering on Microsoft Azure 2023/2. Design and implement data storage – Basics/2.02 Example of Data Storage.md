# 2.2 Example of Data Storage

- [ ] In the next set of chapters I want to give a quick example of an application that I have written in .NET, and how we can make the application actually consume a few of the data services on the Azure platform<br/>

- [ ] I want to give an initial focus on a .NET application being able to fetch data from an Azure SQL database and an Azure storage account<br/>

- [ ] For this, I have already developed a .NET program. That program is available as a zip file in the resource that is attached onto this chapter<br/>

- [ ] In order to work with that program, we don't need to do anything much with the program itself<br/>

- [ ] You guys need to have the ability to run the program<br/>

- [ ] We need to have Visual Studio 2022 in place. This is the new version of Visual Studio<br/>

- [ ] What you can do is you can download the community additional accounts on Visual Studio<br/>

- [ ] It is a very simple download and installation process<br/>

- [ ] In the next chapter, I just have some images in place to showcase how you can install Visual Studio<br/>

- [ ] Once you have Visual Studio in place on your machine, I am on a Windows laptop, I am going to run Visual Studio 2022<br/>

- [ ] I will right click and run it as an administrator<br/>

- [ ] I have gone ahead and downloaded the zip contents<br/>

- [ ] I will right click on this file and say "Extract all"<br/>

- [ ] I will just extract it on the same location<br/>

- [ ] If I go onto SQL app, I have my solution file, and I have some project files in place<br/>

- [ ] In Visual Studio 2022, I will click on "Open a project or solution", go on to my temporary folder, which I have on my local machine, you can have it in any temporary folder<br/>

- [ ] Go onto SQL app and click on the solution file<br/>

- [ ] I am not going to go through the .NET program as such<br/>

- [ ] This is a very simple program that is reading a CSV file, a comma separated file. It is actually within the files folder<br/>

- [ ] Within the data.csv file, I have information with 3 records in place<br/>

    :::info
        I am just kind of envisioning that this application is just providing information about, let us say 3 courses
    :::

- [ ] I have an ID for each row of information. I have an image that I want to display. Now, these images are in the images folder. So, if I go onto wwwroot, I do have an images folder and I have different images in place<br/>

- [ ] I have the name of the item and there's some sort of rating for the item itself<br/>

- [ ] This application, a very simple application, is just to display information about these 3 courses<br/>

- [ ] If I click on this button to run the SQL app locally. I am choosing the main program itself<br/>

- [ ] I will click on this Run button to actually run this application on my laptop. I will click on "Yes" here<br/>

    :::info
        Please note that if you are working on a company laptop you might not have the required permissions to maybe install Visual Studio and maybe run the program locally
    :::

- [ ] I have different code services in place. If I go on this course service here, here is where I have the code in which I am reading the information from the data.csv file and then also reading those images as well<br/>
