# 2.10 Different File Formats

- [ ] I quickly want to go through some of the data formats that we can actually work with when it comes onto our data<br/>

## CSV

- [ ] One of the simplest file format is a comma separated file. Here I have one comma separated file opened up in Microsoft Excel<br/>

- [ ] This is very simple wherein we have different fields of information actually separated by commas and we can open up this file in Microsoft Excel accordingly<br/>

- [ ] It shows our data in the form of columns and rows<br/>

- [ ] This is actually the audit logs when it comes onto the my Azure account for the last three months<br/>

- [ ] We have information such as the correlation ID, the operation name, the status, et cetera<br/>

- [ ] The first row is basically the header row which is telling us what the information is all about, what's the column header, and then we have the rows of information<br/>

## JSON

- [ ] You can also have data in JSON-based format that is JavaScript Object Notation<br/>

- [ ] It is actually not complicated to go ahead and represent your data in JSON format<br/>

- [ ] In JSON, you can have various objects that are enclosed within the curly braces here, and with each object you can have your columns of information<br/>

- [ ] If you want to represent your columns of information, they are represented, as simple key value pairs<br/>

- [ ] Each object will have that keyword of correlation ID, operation name, et cetera and you will have the values accordingly<br/>

## Avro

- [ ] Companies are looking at much more efficient ways of storing data within a file and better ways of actually extracting the information from the file itself<br/>

- [ ] This is a row-based file format<br/>

- [ ] If you want a filter on particular rows within your data file, you can make use of the Avro file format<br/>

- [ ] What's the key difference between this Avro file format and let us say the CSV file format? Well, the data itself is actually stored as you can see in binary format<br/>

- [ ] We can read the data within the file but when it comes onto the Avro file format, this data is stored in binary format<br/>

- [ ] Why is it stored in this format? It is ideal for compressing data. This results in less storage of the file itself, and hence when you want to transfer this file over the network, you need less bandwidth requirements<br/>

## Parquet

- [ ] This is based on the columnar data format<br/>

- [ ] What does that mean? This kind of stores information in an efficient way when it comes onto columns of data<br/>

- [ ] If you only want to work with certain columns of data within your data file, consider using the Parquet-based file format<br/>

- [ ] You can use different coding schemes in the Parquet-based file format also, the columns name are also stored within the file itself and even their data type is also stored in the file<br/>
