# 2.7 Thoughts on Udemy storing data

- [ ] If you look at the full-blown web application, if you consider the Udemy platform, can you imagine the amount of data that they consume on a daily basis?<br/>

- [ ] The platform itself will first of all have data with regards to its students, its courses, et cetera<br/>

- [ ] Udemy as a company should also look at the data they have collected and analyze the data accordingly<br/>

- [ ] To look at both of these aspects just to try to understand this, what information does Udemy need to store?<br/>

- [ ] First of all, it needs to store information about its video courses<br/>

- [ ] Each course has a name, it has the instructor, it has the different ratings, it has the price, et cetera<br/>

- [ ] All of this information could be structured information that could be stored within a particular table, let us say in a SQL or relational database engine<br/>

        I don't know how Udemy is actually storing the information. This entire chapter is just to have some thought process onto how a company can make their application store information accordingly

- [ ] If you go on to each course itself, apart from all of this, Udemy has to also make place for the different videos that are uploaded by the instructors<br/>

- [ ] Where can they store these videos? Probably using the blob service in an Azure storage account<br/>

- [ ] Just giving a quick example on how you could store the videos using maybe the blob service in an Azure storage account<br/>

- [ ] The video name itself, the chapter name, could again be stored in, let us say, another table within an Azure SQL database or a relational database engine<br/>

- [ ] What about the data that it needs to analyze?<br/>

- [ ] Udemy as a company wants to look at the information based on the purchases of students and see in what way they can improve their services to students<br/>

- [ ] How can they improve the purchasing power of the students on the Udemy platform?<br/>

- [ ] How they can provide better services to their students?<br/>

- [ ] They can take the data that they have collected when it comes onto the purchases being made by students across the world and perform analysis accordingly<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto an application, you have to understand that there is a lot of aspects when it comes onto data storage, data usage, and data analysis<br/>
