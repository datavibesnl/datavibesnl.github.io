# 2.3 Itâ€™s time to use the cloud

- [ ] I had gone through a very simple .NET program that is reading information from a CSV file, a comma separated file. Each field of information was being separated by a comma and each line of information was being separated by the new line feed character<br/>

- [ ] At the same time, my application was also fetching images from an images folder. Now, please note that all of this information is being contained within the project itself, but you know that when a company hosts an application that application has to interact with a lot of data<br/>

- [ ] You will not contain that data, you know that CSV information data, and the images data within the application itself<br/>

- [ ] You need to have different storage locations for data storage. <br/>

- [ ] Ideally have one data store for storing that CSV-based information and maybe another data store for storing the images<br/>

- [ ] What we are going to be seeing now is the usage of a service known as an Azure Storage Account, which we will use for storing the images, and an Azure SQL database for storing the application data<br/>

        Please note that you could store your images and the data.csv file hazardous in the Azure Storage Account

        We don't need the SQL database, but since you want to look at the relational aspects of a database engine, I am going forward with the implementation of the Azure SQL database
