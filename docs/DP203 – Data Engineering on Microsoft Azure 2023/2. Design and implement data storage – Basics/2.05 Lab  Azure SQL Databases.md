# 2.5 Lab  Azure SQL Databases

- [ ] In this chapter, I want to deploy a resource-based on the Azure SQL Database Service<br/>

- [ ] I want to host that data that we have in our data.csv file about the different courses within a very simple table on an Azure SQL database<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto a relational database system, so let us say SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, et cetera, you would probably install the software first on a server machine<br/>

- [ ] Then with the help of the database engine, it will store the tabular data, first of all, on the disk itself<br/>

- [ ] When you want to view the data, you can invoke SQL-based commands that will allow you to view the data in the form of tables<br/>

- [ ] You submit that SQL query onto the database engine<br/>

- [ ] The engine will then take the data and then give it to you in tabular format<br/>

- [ ] If you want to host a SQL database on the Azure platform, there are a couple of ways you can actually go about doing this<br/>

    1. When you want to host a database engine, you first need to have a machine in place

- [ ] On the Azure platform, you can spin up an Azure virtual machine then install the database software then start creating your database tables and storing your data<br/>

- [ ] You also need to look at admin level tasks, for example, backup of your data, high availability of the entire infrastructure, etc.<br/>

    2. On the Azure platform, they are giving you another service named Azure SQL database service. This is basically a platform as a service wherein the infrastructure is managed for you

- [ ] You don't need to spin up the virtual machines that compute infrastructure that is required for hosting your database<br/>

    :::info
        All of this is managed for you

## How to create an SQl database service?

- [ ] Let us go ahead and create an instance based on the Azure SQL database service<br/>

- [ ] Go on All Resources and hit on the Create button to create an instance or resource-based on the SQL database service<br/>

- [ ] Or go to SQL databases on the left-hand side navigation pane<br/>

- [ ] Click on the Create button<br/>

- [ ] We are presented with a wizard in which we need to put what are different aspects for our SQL database<br/>

- [ ] We need to specify a subscription and we need a resource group<br/>

- [ ] Make use of the same resource group that we used in the prior chapter<br/>

- [ ] I have to give a name for the database that is going to be hosted<br/>

- [ ] What you do is just to give a database name and also give the details about creating something known as a database server<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Create new`** link underneath the Select a server dropdown menu<br/>

- [ ] The underlying aspects of the database  server is going to be managed for you but user give different aspects about the database server itself<br/>

- [ ] I will give it a unique name for the server<br/>

- [ ] Specify the location as North Europe<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the authentication, so how do you want to authenticate onto your database server? <br/>

- [ ] Specify SQL authentication as the authentication method for the database server<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the password there are some constraints that needs to match when you specify the password<br/>

- [ ] Click on the OK button<br/>

- [ ] In terms of compute and storage, click on configure database<br/>

- [ ] If you are using the Azure free account for the first month, wherein you get the $200 worth of free credit, when it comes onto the service tier, I believe you can only choose the basic, in terms something known as DTU and that is fine<br/>

    :::info
        There are just different models based on your workload
    :::

- [ ] In a production-environment, you could use models such as the Premium, which has better availability and performance but obviously you pay more<br/>

- [ ] Since we are starting to do a demo, let us go ahead and just choose the basic DTU model<br/>

- [ ] If you scroll down, you will see the estimated cost per month<br/>

- [ ] On the Azure platform or any cloud platform, you are only charged based on how much you use<br/>

- [ ] Click on the Apply button<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the backup storage redundancy, I choose locally redundant storage just to reduce the overall cost<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Next: Networking`** button<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the connectivity method, I will choose a public endpoint<br/>

    :::info
        By default, there will be a firewall that limits connections onto the database itself
    :::

- [ ] I will say to allow Azure services and also add my current client IP address<br/>

    :::info
        This will allow me to establish a connection from my laptop onto the SQL database
    :::

- [ ] Go onto **`Next: Security`**<br/>

- [ ] Go onto **`Additional Settings`**, on **`Tags`**, onto **`Review`** and click **`Create`**<br/>

    :::info
        This particular wizard is going to create 2 resources for us. One is a SQL database server and the other is a SQL database
    :::

- [ ] Once a deployment is complete, I can go onto Resource<br/>

    :::info
        This will take me onto the SQL database
    :::

- [ ] If I go onto All Resources, you will see now we have 3 resources in place<br/>

    1. Our prior Azure storage account

    2. A SQL database 

    3. A SQL database server

- [ ] If I go onto the SQL database, let us connect onto it<br/>

- [ ] We have something known as the query editor wherein we can actually fire queries directly on this SQL database<br/>

- [ ] It is asking me to authenticate so the password I had mentioned earlier on for sqladmin, I will enter it here and hit on the OK button<br/>

- [ ] We have kind of a query window on the right hand side. We have our tables<br/>

    :::info
        We don't have any tables so far in place
    :::

- [ ] I have this commands sheet here wherein I will execute some simple SQL-based commands<br/>

- [ ] First is to create a simple table with a name of course. This has four columns<br/>

    1. CourseID of the type integer for integer-based values.

    2. ExamImage, this will put in the URL for each image that we have. This is going to be of the type varchar

    3. CourseName

    4. Rating

- [ ] Go ahead and take this command to create the table<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Course (
            CourseID int,
            ExamImage varchar(1000),
            CourseName varchar(1000),
            Rating numeric(2, 1)
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Place the command here in the query window and click on the Run button<br/>

- [ ] If I hit on the refresh button here, if I expand tables, I can see my course table in place<br/>

    :::info
        This dbo is nothing but the schema that gets preprinted along with the table name
    :::

- [ ] The next command is to now insert data. I want to insert 3 rows like we had the 3 rows in our data.csv file<br/>

- [ ] In terms of each information, in terms of the values, right? I have the course ID. I have what is a location of the image and what is the name of the course and the rating<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto this entire URL, so remember when it came onto the images that we upload as part of our Azure Storage Account, we got a unique URL for each image<br/>

    :::info
        Change the names of the URL to the new name of the storage account we created in a previous lecture
    :::

    :::info
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO Course(
            CourseID,
            ExamImage,
            CourseName,
            Rating
        ) VALUES(
            1,
            'https://datastore243434.blob.core.windows.net/images/AZ-204.jpg',
            'AZ-204 Developing Azure solutions',
            4.5
        )
        
        INSERT INTO Course(
            CourseID,
            ExamImage,
            CourseName,
            Rating
        ) VALUES(
            2,
            'https://datastore243434.blob.core.windows.net/images/DP-900.jpg',
            'AZ-303 Architecting Azure solutions',
            4.6
        )
        
        INSERT INTO Course(
            CourseID,
            ExamImage,
            CourseName,
            Rating
        ) VALUES(
            3,
            'https://datastore243434.blob.core.windows.net/images/DP-203.jpg',
            'DP-203 Azure Data Engineer',
            4.7
        )
        
        
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We can use the select command to select all of the rows in the table<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM Course
        ```
