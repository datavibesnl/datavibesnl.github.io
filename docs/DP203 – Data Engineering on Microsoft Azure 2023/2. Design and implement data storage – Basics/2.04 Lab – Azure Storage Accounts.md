# 2.4 Lab â€“ Azure Storage Accounts

## Azure Storage Account Services 

- [ ] Azure Storage Accounts is just a service on the Azure platform that allows storage of data on the cloud<br/>

- [ ] With the default Azure Storage Account that you get, you get different services that you can use<br/>

### 1. **`Blob service`**

- [ ] This is object storage<br/>

- [ ] You could upload a file onto the service. That file is treated as a binary object<br/>

- [ ] This service is good when you want to upload objects such as your **audio files**, your **video files**, your **images**, et cetera<br/>

- [ ] You could also upload your normal files as well. The only thing is that this service treats each file as an object<br/>

### 2. **`Table service`**

- [ ] You have the Table service where you can actually stored structured NoSQL data<br/>

### 3. **`File service`**

- [ ] You could have file shares that could be connected onto different systems<br/>

### 4. **`Queue service`**

- [ ] If you have messages that need to be sent by different components of a distributed application, you can make use of the Queue service<br/>

- [ ] We are going to be focusing just on the Blob service and that is because we have to focus on another variation of the Azure Storage Account, and that is the Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage Account<br/>

## How to create an Azure Storage Account

- [ ] Sign in to the Azure portal<br/>

- [ ] Go onto the All Resources section in the left-hand side navigation pane<br/>

- [ ] Or I can directly go onto the **`Storage accounts`** link from the left-hand side navigation pane<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`Create`** button<br/>

- [ ] This will provide us with a wizard which we can use to go ahead and create the Azure storage account<br/>

- [ ] Each resource that you create on the Azure platform needs to be linked onto a subscription<br/>

    :::info
        This is used for billing purposes
    :::

- [ ] It needs to be tagged onto a resource group that is used for a logical grouping of resources<br/>

- [ ] If you don't have a resource group in place, you can hit on the **`Create New`** button to create a new resource group<br/>

    :::info
        Please note there is no charge for creating a resource group
    :::

- [ ] Press OK<br/>

    :::info
        It used to logically group your resources together
    :::

- [ ] Give a unique name for the storage account<br/>

- [ ] In terms of a region, so we have regions across the world in which Azure hosts their services in their different data centers<br/>

    :::info
        You can choose a location that let us say is closest to your customer
    :::

- [ ] Choose the location as North Europe<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the performance, I will leave it as standard<br/>

- [ ] I am going to do something known as locally-redundant storage. This is kind of the least cost when it comes onto the redundancy of data within a storage account<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto the section of security and monitoring, we are going to look at the different aspects when it comes on an Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage account<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Next: Advanced`**<br/>

- [ ] We can click on the different buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate through the wizard<br/>

    :::info
        For the wizard, when you create a resource based on a service on the Azure platform, here are the different categories on top. For each category, you will have some properties that you need to configure
    :::

- [ ] When it comes onto the storage account, I will leave everything as it is. I will go onto Tags, go onto Review<br/>

- [ ] Hit on the Create button<br/>

    :::info
        When I hit on the Create button, we are now telling the Azure resource manager to please go ahead and create a storage account for us
    :::

- [ ] Once the deployment is complete, you should get a notification that the deployment has succeeded<br/>

- [ ] Click on the link to **`Go to resource`** to view your storage account<br/>

- [ ] You can also go on to All Resources to see your storage account<br/>

- [ ] Click on the storage account to go onto the storage account itself<br/>

- [ ] Click on **`Containers`**<br/>

    :::info
        This is actually mapping onto the blob service I was talking about
    :::

- [ ] When it comes onto an Azure Storage Account, we have basically the blob services maps onto containers. You can create file shares, we can create queues and we can create tables<br/>

- [ ] Click on the **`+ Container`** button to create a new container<br/>

- [ ] Give the container the name **`images`**<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the public access level, just for now I am going to choose blob, anonymous read access for blob only<br/>

- [ ] Hit on the Create button<br/>

- [ ] Go onto the container<br/>

    :::info
        It is like a folder
    :::

- [ ] Click on the Upload button and I can upload the images which we have for our program. <br/>

- [ ] Click on the Browse button<br/>

- [ ] Click on the three images<br/>

- [ ] Click on the open button<br/>

- [ ] Click on Upload <br/>

    :::info
        We are now uploading these files as images onto an images container within an Azure storage account
    :::

- [ ] If you go onto each object within the storage account, you get something known as a URL<br/>

    :::info
        This is what is unique about the storage account
    :::

- [ ] Copy the URL onto the clipboard<br/>

- [ ] Go to another tab in your web browser<br/>

- [ ] Paste the URL inside your web browser<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the URL, you have what is the name of your storage account. The service, it is .blob.core.windows.net, what is the name of my container, and what is the name of the object<br/>
