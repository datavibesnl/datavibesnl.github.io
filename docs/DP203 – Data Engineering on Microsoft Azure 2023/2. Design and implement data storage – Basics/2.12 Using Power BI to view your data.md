# 2.12 Using Power BI to view your data

- [ ] In this chapter, I want to give a quick note when it comes onto visualizing your data<br/>

- [ ] We can use the Power BI Desktop which is free of cost<br/>

- [ ] You can actually install the tool automatically on your system<br/>

- [ ] I am going to start the Power BI desktop tool, which I have already installed on my system<br/>

- [ ] It opens up a screen wherein we can actually start getting our data<br/>

- [ ] If you have closed this particular flash screen, let me close it, you get this editor in place or basically this Power BI desktop in place where you can actually start working on visualizing your data<br/>

- [ ] You can click on this Get data and click on more<br/>

- [ ] Choose the Azure platform<br/>

- [ ] Search for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and click on Connect<br/>

- [ ] Enter the URL, so what I will do is I will go onto my Data Lake Gen 2 Storage Account, go onto the containers, go onto my CSV container where I have my log.csv file in place<br/>

- [ ] Here in the URL, since we are connecting onto an Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage Account, I have to change the service from Blob onto DFS that is used for Data Lake Gen2 Storage<br/>

- [ ] Click on the OK button<br/>

    :::info
        ```sh
        https://datalake244434.dfs.core.windows.net/csv/Log.csv
        ```
    :::

- [ ] It is asking me to basically authenticate myself<br/>

    :::info
        When it comes onto services on the Azure platform, you have a lot of security aspects in place
    :::

- [ ] Choose the shared access signature<br/>

- [ ] Go on to my Azure Data Lake Gen 2 Storage Account, scroll down here to go onto something known as shared access signature to create a new token<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the allowed services, I am going to choose the blob service<br/>

- [ ] Choose all of the resource types<br/>

- [ ] I only want to have the ability to read and list<br/>

- [ ] Scroll down and click on the generate SAS and connection string<br/>

- [ ] Copy the token onto your clipboard and paste inside the token field in Power BI Desktop<br/>

- [ ] Go ahead and hit on the connect button<br/>

- [ ] Click on the load button<br/>

- [ ] Go on transform data and choose to transform the data<br/>

    :::info
        This will open up the Power Query editor
    :::

- [ ] Click on this binary link here<br/>

    :::info
        This should then  open up the contents of the file
    :::

- [ ] In terms of the property, let me replace, or let us rename this as log data<br/>

- [ ] Choose close and apply<br/>

- [ ] If I expand log data we will see all of our column data in place<br/>

- [ ] For example, if you want to have a clustered column chart in place, just click on it<br/>

- [ ] We need to add, what we want to put has a X axis and a Y axis<br/>

- [ ] I want to put the resource type in the X-axis and put the operation name in the Y axis<br/>

- [ ] What you can see is the count of operation names based on the resource type<br/>

- [ ] Once you have your data stored somewhere, you can then use visualization tools to visualize the data accordingly<br/>
