# 2.14 Note on Costing

- [ ] When it comes onto the data services, there's not much of a cost when it comes onto working with Azure storage accounts and even that comes under the free services for the Azure free account<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto Azure Synapse, et cetera, there is a cost associated because there's nothing that is given as part of the free tier<br/>

- [ ] It is better just to go ahead and delete all of the resources so you don't incur any sort of cost. Because it is very easy to go ahead and recreate the resources on the Azure platform<br/>

- [ ] The next thing that you can do is to create something known as a budget alert<br/>

- [ ] You can be notified if your costs are going beyond a particular threshold<br/>

- [ ] In order to go ahead and do this, we can go on to our subscription service<br/>

    :::info
        Your subscriptions are used for billing purposes
    :::

- [ ] I have a subscription in place that is based on the pay-as-you-go model<br/>

- [ ] Click on the subscription<br/>

- [ ] You can go onto something known as budgets<br/>

- [ ] Click on the Add button<br/>

- [ ] You can actually add a budget in place. So, let us say I am creating a monthly budget, you have the creation and the expiration date<br/>

- [ ] Specify the budget amount per month<br/>

- [ ] Click on the Next button<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the alert conditions, you can specify a type of alert. So, let us say the forecast amount of your usage is going to reach 70% of your budget<br/>

- [ ] You can then be notified via an email<br/>

- [ ] Whenever the threshold is going to be reached, when it comes on to 70% of your budget, an email will be sent<br/>

- [ ] You can scroll down and hit on the create button and it should go ahead and create your budget accordingly<br/>
