# 2.8 Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage Account

- [ ] We are looking at working with big data<br/>

- [ ] When you have a lot of data available, you are looking at working with larger datasets, data that is arriving in large volumes and arriving at a very fast rate<br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto the Azure platform, you can make use of the Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage account<br/>

    :::info
        This service itself is built on top of Azure Blob Storage
    :::

- [ ] When you create an Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account, you are basically creating an Azure Storage account that just has this feature of data like within it<br/>

    :::info
        This gives the ability for an enterprise to host a data lake on the Azure platform
    :::

- [ ] You also get this feature of an hierarchical namespace on top of Azure Blob Storage<br/>

    :::info
        This helps you to organize your objects and files into our hierarchy of directories for efficient data access
    :::

- [ ] The entire idea of having a data lake in place is having the ability to store large amounts of data in its native raw format<br/>

    :::info
        You could have data in various formats. You could have data in JSON-based files. You could have CSV-based files, you could have Parquet-based files, ORC-based files, videos, images, et cetera
    :::

- [ ] Data Lake should also be optimized when it comes onto storing terabytes and even petabytes of data<br/>

- [ ] The data could come in from various sources<br/>
