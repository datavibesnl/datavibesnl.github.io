# 3.3 Lab â€“ Setting up a new Azure SQL dat

- [ ] In order to look at some T-SQL queries, I am first going to spin a new resource based on the Azure SQL database <br/>

- [ ] Inside the Azure Portal, go to All resources section<br/>

- [ ] Go onto SQL databases in the left-hand side navigation pane<br/>

- [ ] Hit on the create button <br/>

- [ ] Choose the resource group <br/>

- [ ] Give a database name <br/>

- [ ] Give the information for a new server by specifying its unique name and location<br/>

- [ ] In terms of authentication for the database server, use SQL authentication and specify a username and a password <br/>

- [ ] Click on OK <br/>

- [ ] In terms of the compute and storage for the database, I will click on configure database, and let us choose the budget friendly option that is the basic DTU model <br/>

- [ ] Hit on the apply button <br/>

- [ ] Choose locally redundant backup storage<br/>

- [ ] Go on next for networking <br/>

- [ ] Choose public endpoint <br/>

- [ ] Allow Azure services, allow the current client IP address <br/>

- [ ] Go onto next for security, go onto additional settings <br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto additional settings, when it comes on to use existing data, I am going to choose sample <br/>

    :::info
        There is a sample database along with some tables and information that gets installed as part of the database
    :::

- [ ] Go onto next for tags <br/>

- [ ] Go on to review and let us go ahead and hit on create<br/>

- [ ] Once the deployment is complete, go on resource and let us go onto the query editor<br/>

- [ ] Log into the database<br/>

- [ ] If I expand the tables now, you will see tables in place, and this is because we have chosen to install that sample database<br/>

- [ ] If I go onto the context menu and choose select the top 1000 rows, you will actually see the information here <br/>
