# 3.11 Quick Review on Primary and Foreign

- [ ] When you create a table, you can actually define one column or a set of columns, as the primary key for the table itself<br/>

    :::info
        If you have just created the table without any data, after that also you can actually define the primary key for the table
    :::

- [ ] The primary key acts as a unique identifier when it comes onto the rows within a particular table<br/>

- [ ] We have various columns when it comes onto the product table itself<br/>

- [ ] You can see this PK attribute when it comes onto the product ID, that means product ID is behaving as the primary key for this particular table<br/>

    :::info
        That means when we enter any row of information within the product table, the product ID needs to be unique
    :::

- [ ] It needs to uniquely identify the row within the table<br/>

- [ ] If I do a SELECT * FROM SalesLT and the Product table here on execute, this number needs to be unique<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Product
        ```
    :::

- [ ] You can't have 2 rows of information that has the same product ID so that is when it comes on to the primary key<br/>

- [ ] Another sort of key that we have is the foreign key. Here you will see that we have 2 columns of data: the product category ID and the product model ID<br/>

- [ ] Foreign keys means they actually reference a primary key within another table<br/>

    :::info
        There is a relationship between the product table and the product category table and the product model table
    :::

- [ ] This relationship has been developed when you go through the process of something known as database normalization<br/>

- [ ] Instead of actually having all of the information when it comes onto the products, the product category, and the product description within one table itself, when you go through the process of normalization, you actually split your data across various tables<br/>

- [ ] That is why you have one product table that has information about the product itself<br/>

- [ ] You have another table that is known as the product category table that has information about the category itself and since the product needs to belong onto a particular product category, that is why there is a link between the product table and the product category table<br/>

## Why the use of a foreign key?

- [ ] If I go on to database diagrams here in SQL Server Management Studio let me right click, and create a new database diagram<br/>

- [ ] It is saying that it needs one of these supported objects for the database. Do I want to create them? I will click on yes<br/>

- [ ] In adding the table, I will choose the product table, the product category table, and the product model table. I will click on the add button<br/>

- [ ] Once they are added onto the database diagram, I will hit on the close button<br/>

- [ ] You will see in terms of the diagram, there is a relationship between the product table and the product category table<br/>

- [ ] This is based on the product category ID and there is a relationship between the product table and the product model table<br/>

- [ ] The use of primary keys is to help uniquely identify rows within a particular table, and the foreign keys are used to link multiple tables together<br/>
