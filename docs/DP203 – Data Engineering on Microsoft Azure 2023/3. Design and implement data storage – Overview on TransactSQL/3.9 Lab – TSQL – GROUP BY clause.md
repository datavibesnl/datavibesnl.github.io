# 3.9 Lab – TSQL – GROUP BY clause

- [ ] The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows into summary rows and this can be used along with your aggregate functions<br/>

- [ ] I am going to use the COUNT aggregate function to get the count of the ProductID from within the SalesLT Product table<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(ProductID) FROM SalesLT.Product
        ```
    :::

- [ ] I can group this information by one of the columns that is available within the table itself<br/>

- [ ] Let us say I want to group this information by the color<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(ProductID) FROM SalesLT.Product
        GROUP BY Color
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Apart from just selecting the Count of Products, since I am grouping by the color, let me order choose the color column as well<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT Color, COUNT(ProductID) FROM SalesLT.Product
        GROUP BY Color
        ```
    :::

- [ ] When we go through transforming data, when loading data into a SQL data warehouse, we will see what we can do when it comes on to having this sort of information in place<br/>

- [ ] If you want to ensure that you get this results set without having those rows that have null values, we can use the WHERE clause here. So, only give me those rows of information where the color is not null<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT Color, COUNT(ProductID) FROM SalesLT.Product
        WHERE Color IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY Color
        ```
