# 3.12 Lab – TSQL – Creating Tables with K

- [ ] When it comes on to creating tables with primary keys and foreign keys, I have the SQL script in place that creates 3 tables<br/>

    1. A Customer table that has the customer ID and the customer name. I define the primary key as the customer ID

    :::info
        When we create the customer table, the customer ID is going to behave as the primary key
    :::

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Customer (
            CustomerID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            CustomerName VARCHAR(1000),
            PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID)
        )
        ```
    :::

    2. I am creating another table known as a course table that has the course ID and the course name and the price, and here the primary key is a course ID itself

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Course (
            CourseID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            CourseName VARCHAR(1000),
            Price REAL,
            PRIMARY KEY (CourseID)
        )
        ```
    :::

    3. Creating an orders table, which has the order ID, the course ID and the customer ID and discount percentage or discount percent. Here, I am saying that there's a foreign key wherein we want to reference the customer ID from the customer table

    :::info
        The customer ID column here will actually reference the customer ID in the customer table. And the course ID actually references the course ID in the course table
    :::

- [ ] I can define here a primary key for the orders table and this can be our order ID<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Orders (
            OrderID VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            CourseID VARCHAR(100),
            CustomerID VARCHAR(100),
            Discountpercent INT,
            PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
            FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID),
            FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We can create these tables actually within our appdb database itself<br/>

- [ ] In this query window which I already have open, I will paste in all of the statements to create these tables<br/>

- [ ] If you click on tables here and hit on the refresh button, we will see our course table, our customer table and the orders table<br/>

- [ ] Insert some values into the customer table. So, I am inserting 3 rows of information. I have the customer ID and the customer name<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO Customer(
            CustomerID,
            CustomerName
        ) VALUES (
            "C1",
            "UserA"
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Customer (
            CustomerID,
            CustomerName
        ) VALUES (
            "C2",
            "UserB"
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Customer (
            CustomerID,
            CustomerName
        ) VALUES (
            "C3",
            "UserC"
        );
        ```
    :::

- [ ] Let us insert some rows into the course table. So, again, I am inserting 3 rows of information<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO Course (
            CourseID, 
            CourseName, 
            Price
        ) VALUES (
            "D1",
            "AZ-900",
            99.99
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Course (
            CourseID,
            CourseName,
            Price
        ) VALUES (
            "D2",
            "DP-900",
            100.99
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Course (
            CourseID,
            CourseName,
            Price
        ) VALUES (
            "D3",
            "AZ-104",
            89.99
        );
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We can insert the information into the orders table<br/>

- [ ] In terms of the orders table, I am ensuring that I have a course ID that is defined in the course table and a customer ID that is defined in the customer table<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO Orders (
            OrderID,
            CourseID,
            CustomerID,
            Discountpercent
        ) VALUES (
            'O1',
            'D2',
            'C1',
            90
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Orders (
            OrderID,
            CourseID,
            CustomerID,
            Discountpercent
        ) VALUES (
            'O2',
            'D1',
            'C2',
            50
        );
        
        INSERT INTO Orders (
            OrderID,
            CourseID,
            CustomerID,
            Discountpercent
        ) VALUES (
            'O3',
            'D3',
            'C3',
            60
        )
        ```
    :::

- [ ] If I try to insert a row of information into the orders table where I have a unique OrderID, I do have a courseID that is defined as D3<br/>

- [ ] This is available in the course table, but I am putting a customer ID of C4<br/>

- [ ] The customer ID is not defined in the customer table. If I try to insert this record into the table, I am going to get an error<br/>

- [ ] It is a foreign key constraint error, because I don't have that information defined in the customer table<br/>
