# 3.2 The internals of a database engine

- [ ] When you want to use a relational database system such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL, the first thing is obviously you need to install the software on a machine and you can start hosting your data <br/>

- [ ] When it comes onto a SQL-based database that you can host with your tables, everything is in the form of structured data when you have tables that is storing your information within a database <br/>

- [ ] With the database itself, you run something known as SQL queries, your structured query language queries against your database tables <br/>

    :::info
        For example, if you want to view the data within your table you will issue, let us say, the SELECT statement
    :::

- [ ] I am giving a very simple example here of a table which has 3 columns and 4 rows of information. You have the customer ID, the customer name, and the address, and you have 4 rows of information <br/>

| CustomerID | CustomerName | Address |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | CustomerA | AddressA |
| 2 | CustomerB | AddressB |
| 3 | CustomerC | AddressC |
| 4 | CustomerD | AddressD |

- [ ] Let us say as a user, you only want to see the information wherein the customer ID is equal to 2 <br/>

- [ ] You will fire this particular query, this language query against the database server <br/>

    :::info
        Please note that when it comes on to this data itself, it is actually stored on disk or storage which is managed by the database server
    :::

    :::info
        This data is actually not stored in the form of tables, it is raw data that is stored on the disk itself
    :::

- [ ] It is only when you fire a query against the database engine, the database engine will use its processing power to take that query and give you the information accordingly <br/>

- [ ] If you want to see the data within a table, you will have a client tool that can take in that information and display the information accordingly <br/>
