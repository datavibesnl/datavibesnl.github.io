# 3.6 Lab  TSQL  WHERE Clause

- [ ] The WHERE clause can be used to extract only those records from within a table that fulfill a specified condition<br/>

- [ ] Let us say you want to get this information from the table, the ProductID, the name and the product number but you want to put a specific filter condition<br/>

- [ ] You only want to get the information about the product where the productid is equal to 680<br/>

- [ ] In the WHERE clause, we can say where the ProductID is equal to 680<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            Name,
            ProductNumber
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        WHERE ProductID = 680
        ```
    :::

- [ ] If you want to get the list of products where the ProductID is greater than 680, we can hit on execute<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            Name,
            ProductNumber
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        WHERE ProductID > 680
        ```
    :::

- [ ] We can also put wherein the ProductID is between a set of values. So, let us say between 680 and 900<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            Name,
            ProductNumber
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        WHERE ProductID BETWEEN 680 AND 900
        ```
    :::

- [ ] If you want to get the records from the table based on a string keyword within the name itself, so for example, I can say that only return to me the records in the table where the name is LIKE, let us say I want to find products which have the keyword or the string of Road within them. I will put road here, and just to signify that any characters can come probably before this particular keyword. And any number of characters can come after this particular keyword<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
            Name,
            ProductNumber
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        WHERE Name LIKE "%Road%"
        ```
