# 3.5 Lab  TSQL  SELECT clause

- [ ] I am logged into SQL Server Management Studio<br/>

- [ ] We are going to look at some basic SQL commands that you can execute against your data that is stored in the Azure SQL database<br/>

- [ ] I am going to right-click on appdb<br/>

- [ ] I will choose to create a New Query<br/>

- [ ] We are trying to execute a query against the database<br/>

- [ ] The first statement we are going to see is the SELECT statement<br/>

- [ ] If you want to see the data within a table in your database you can go ahead and issue the SELECT statement. If you want to return all of the columns of information from within a table, we can do * FROM. What is the table name? SalesLT is the default schema that is part of this sample database. And what's the table we want to get the information from? So, let us say I want information from the Product table<br/>

- [ ] Let me hit on the Execute button here<br/>

- [ ] If you want to see the number of rows within the table as a result of the query, we can use the function of COUNT<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT
            COUNT(*)
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        ```
    :::

- [ ] If you only want to get certain column information from the table, we just need to go ahead and enter the column name. For example, I want to get what is the ProductID, only that information, let us say the name of the product, and most probably, let us say the ProductNumber<br/>

    :::info
        ```sql
        SELECT 
            ProductID,
             Name,
            ProductNumber
        FROM SalesLT.Product
        
        ```
